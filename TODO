- use werkzeug instead of WebOb (for Request, Response obj + Gunicorn)
- research for ASGI (see Bocadillo)

- integrate with poetry(?) and remove .coveragerc file
- fix working dir (gunicorn fails to start if not inside src/)
- do we want to support templates and MVT pattern?
- re-write "parse" library -> simplify and exclude type-validation (use Pydantic instead?)
- make installable -> add "install" step with poetry to ci.yml

- refactor tests
