- use werkzeug instead of WebOb (for Request, Response obj + Gunicorn) or re-write from scratch
- research for ASGI (see Bocadillo)

- do we want to support templates and MVT pattern?
- re-write "parse" library -> simplify and exclude type-validation (use Pydantic instead?)
- remove gunicorn as core deps

- refactor tests
- add coverage badge?

- add support in where clauses for other fields (in addition to id)
- refactor select_tables_sql
- NB: verify that all types of select etc work with FK's and reading their properties
- refactor _select_all and _select_where => combine in single method with optional where clause
